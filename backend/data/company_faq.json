We work with everyone from single-outlet restaurants to multi-city chains."

    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to partner with Swiggy?",
      "answer": "For restaurants, Swiggy works on a commission model, typically 15% to 25% per order depending on factors like your location, restaurant type, and order volume.

    },
    {
      "question": "How long does onboarding take?",
      "answer": "The onboarding process is quite fast. Once you submit your restaurant details and documents, verification typically takes 2-4 business days. After approval, we'll do a menu photoshoot, set up your online menu, and train your staff on our partner app. Most restaurants go live within 5-7 days from initial signup. For cloud kitchens ready to start, it can be even faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to manage delivery myself?",
      "answer": "Not at all. That's the beauty of partnering with Swiggy. We have our own fleet of delivery partners who handle all deliveries. You just need to prepare the food and pack it well. Our delivery executives pick it up and deliver to customers. You get to focus completely on cooking great food, while we handle the entire delivery logistics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documents do I need to get started?",
      "answer": "You'll need your FSSAI license, GST registration, PAN card, bank account details, and restaurant owner's ID proof. For newer establishments still getting FSSAI, we can work with your application acknowledgment in some cases. The process is straightforward and our partner onboarding team guides you through everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I receive payments?",
      "answer": "Swiggy settles payments weekly, directly to your bank account. You'll receive payment for all orders delivered in a week, minus our commission and any applicable taxes. We provide detailed invoices and transaction reports through your partner dashboard. Everything is transparent and trackable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will Swiggy help with marketing my restaurant?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. All partner restaurants get organic visibility on our app based on ratings, cuisine, and location. Additionally, we run regular campaigns, offer promotional discounts, and feature restaurants in curated collections. You can also opt for paid promotions like banner ads and boosted listings to increase visibility further. Our marketing team works with partners during festivals and special occasions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I manage orders?",
      "answer": "You'll use the Swiggy Partner app on your phone or tablet. When an order comes in, you get an instant notification. You can accept it, prepare the food, and mark it ready for pickup. The app shows you real-time order status, delivery tracking, earnings, and customer feedback. It's very intuitive and our team trains your staff on how to use it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the peak hours and how can I maximize orders?",
      "answer": "Typical peak hours are lunch (12 PM - 2 PM) and dinner (7 PM - 10 PM), plus weekends. To maximize orders, maintain good ratings, keep your menu updated, ensure fast preparation times, and be available during peak hours. We also recommend running discounts during slow periods and participating in our promotional campaigns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I control my menu pricing on Swiggy?",
      "answer": "Yes, you have full control over your menu and pricing. Many restaurants keep slightly higher prices on delivery platforms to account for commission and packaging costs, which is completely acceptable. You can update your menu, prices, and availability anytime through the partner app. We recommend pricing strategically to remain competitive while maintaining profitability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I want to run my own discounts or offers?",
      "answer": "You can absolutely run your own discounts. You set the discount percentage and duration, and you bear the cost of that discount. Swiggy also runs platform-level discounts where we share the discount cost with you. Discounts are a great way to attract new customers and boost orders during slow periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Swiggy ensure food quality during delivery?",
      "answer": "We train our delivery partners on proper food handling. We recommend using high-quality packaging that keeps food fresh and prevents spills. We also have strict delivery time targets to ensure food reaches customers hot and fresh. Customer ratings and feedback help us monitor quality, and we work with partners to continuously improve."

    {
      "question": "What kind of support does Swiggy provide to partners?",
